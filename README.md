</div>


#### How to Play
Download or clone the project from the GitHub repository.
Run the project in your IDE.
Two players can play this game.
The first player has to enter either X or O for any one box.
The second player then enters the other X or O (opposite to what the first player has entered).
The game continues unless any one of them gets a line cut either diagonally or straight.
The person who founds the line is the winner of the game.

#### Conclusion
This project is a great way to learn the basics of Java, Java Swing, Java GUI, and JFrame. It is a fun game that you can play with your friends and family.

## About Internship

As a student who recently completed the LETSGROWMORE internship program, I can confidently say that it was a fantastic experience. The community is passionate about creating opportunities for personal and professional growth, and the internship program reflected this commitment.

Throughout the program, I had the chance to engage with diverse people with similar goals, and I learned a lot about leadership development, technical and non-technical skills, and student engagement. The enriching environments and experiences provided by LETSGROWMORE helped me to broaden my knowledge and develop new skills.

Moreover, the LETSGROWMORE internship program was well-organized and structured, providing me with clear objectives and goals to work towards. The community provided me with the necessary support and guidance to achieve my goals, and I felt supported throughout the entire program.

Overall, I would highly recommend the LETSGROWMORE internship program to any student looking to gain personal and professional skills, engage with like-minded individuals, and develop in a positive and enriching environment.
