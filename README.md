As a student who recently completed the LETSGROWMORE internship program, I can confidently say that it was a fantastic experience. The community is passionate about creating opportunities for personal and professional growth, and the internship program reflected this commitment.

Throughout the program, I had the chance to engage with diverse people with similar goals, and I learned a lot about leadership development, technical and non-technical skills, and student engagement. The enriching environments and experiences provided by LETSGROWMORE helped me to broaden my knowledge and develop new skills.

Moreover, the LETSGROWMORE internship program was well-organized and structured, providing me with clear objectives and goals to work towards. The community provided me with the necessary support and guidance to achieve my goals, and I felt supported throughout the entire program.

Overall, I would highly recommend the LETSGROWMORE internship program to any student looking to gain personal and professional skills, engage with like-minded individuals, and develop in a positive and enriching environment.

### Intermediate Level: `Scientific Calculator`

- The intermediate level task is to create a Scientific Calculator in Java using several technologies such as Java, Java Swing, Java AWT, and OOPS. 

- The project aims to build a general-purpose application that can perform basic mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more complex operations like trigonometric functions and logarithms. 

- The Scientific Calculator will allow users to perform calculations on a graphical user interface (GUI) that is intuitive and easy to use. 

- By completing this project, one can demonstrate a good understanding of Java programming concepts, OOPS, and graphical user interface development in Java.

### Advance Level: `Text Editor`

- The advanced level task at hand is to create a Text Editor in Java using several technologies such as Java, Java Swing, Java AWT, JTextArea, JMenuBar, JMenu, and JMenuItems. 

- The project aims to build a Text Editor that allows the user to enter, modify, store, and print text. It incorporates a file menu for making changes to files such as opening, saving, closing, and printing, as well as an edit menu for cutting, copying, and pasting texts. 

- The Text Editor also includes a "Save and Submit" button to save the data and close the file. To detect actions in the project, an ActionListener is implemented. 

- By completing this project, one can demonstrate a strong understanding of advanced Java concepts and showcase their programming skills.
